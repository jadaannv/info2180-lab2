                <h2>What is Chemistry?</h2>

                <p>Chemistry is the science that explores the composition, structure, properties, and changes of matter. 
                    It is a subject that touches every aspect of our lives, from the food we eat to the medicines we take, 
                    the materials that make up our world, and even the air we breathe. Hence why i decided to study this natural
                    science as my major. At its core, chemistry seeks to unravel the mysteries of the tiny particles that make up the universe, 
                    from atoms and molecules to the complex reactions that occur within them. 
                    It's a science that is constantly evolving and in turn driving innovations that shape our future. Despite this passion 
                    for chemistry, IT has always piqued my interest, and continues to do so especially in this new techonological age. 
                </p>
                <p>Chemistry also explains multiple important reactions in our daily life. From the combustion of fuels that power our cars 
                    to the synthesis of life-saving drugs in pharmaceutical laboratories, chemical reactions are the driving force behind 
                    countless processes. Understanding and controlling these reactions is crucial not only for scientific advancement but 
                    also for addressing global challenges like climate change, pollution, and sustainable energy production. We wouldn't
                    want the earth to be water-less in the next 10 years would we?

                <h2>Chemistry in our lives</h2>

                <p>Chemistry is not confined to laboratories and textbooks; it's an integral part of our daily lives. 
                    When you cook, you're using chemical reactions to transform raw ingredients into delicious meals. 
                    Cleaning products, cosmetics, and even the water treatment process all rely on chemical principles. 
                    Moreover, chemistry plays a vital role in addressing pressing issues such as environmental pollution, 
                    the development of renewable energy sources, and the creation of new materials with improved properties.
                </p>
                <p>As we move forward, chemistry, just like IT, will continue to be a driving force behind innovation. 
                    The combination of both IT and  chemistry provides plenty room for innovation and efficiency. 
                    For examplpe, advancements in nanotechnology, discovering new properties of elements or even in developing new medication. </p>
